            <h3>It's nice to meet you!</h3>
            <p>
              I'm running for County Commission in District 3 because I believe
              strong communities are built by people who are rooted in the place
              they call home — and who care for it in both big and small ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Born and raised from East Tennessee. I chose to build my life in
              Jonesborough, upon graduating from ETSU in 2015, I found work with
              Jonesborough Locally Grown's Boone Street Market. It's here in
              Washington County that my values feel most alive.This isn't just
              where I live — it's where I've invested my time, my energy, and my
              heart & home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Professionally, I work as the Director of Food Access with the
              Appalachian Resource Conservation & Development Council,
              supporting conservation, local agriculture, and community-based
              initiatives across the region. Every day, I see how open spaces,
              infrastructure, water quality, and food systems intersect — and
              how local government decisions shape the long-term health of our
              communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently serve as Chair of Keep Jonesborough Beautiful, where I
              work alongside volunteers to protect and enhance the place we call
              home. I'm also involved with Slow Food Tri-Cities, strengthening
              connections between local farmers, food traditions, and community
              health.
            </p>
            <p>
              My commitment to thoughtful planning extends beyond my day-to-day
              work. I served on the advisory board for Johnson City Horizon
              2045, helping shape a long-term vision for responsible growth.
              I've also served as an advisor for Unity Housing, supporting
              efforts to expand access to stable, affordable housing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Food access and dignity have always been central to my work.
              During my time with One Acre Cafe, a community café serving meals
              with dignity regardless of ability to pay, I witnessed firsthand
              how powerful a shared meal can be. It reinforced my belief that
              public service should center humanity, respect, and practical
              solutions to food insecurity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Community building is something I believe in deeply. Over the
              years, I've volunteered and served on planning committees for
              festivals and events across the Tri-Cities, including the Meet the
              Mountains Festival, Blue Plum Festival, and Jonesborough Farm to
              Table Dinner. These gatherings celebrate our culture, support
              local businesses, and remind us how connected we are to one
              another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work and service, you'll most often find me in the
              garden, on a trail, or near the water. Gardening keeps me grounded
              and reinforces my belief in stewardship and patience. Hiking
              through Northeast Tennessee reminds me why smart land use planning
              matters. And I've always had a deep love for rivers and water —
              whether walking a streambank, paddling, or simply sitting by the
              water. Our waterways are part of our identity and our
              responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Food and cooking are another way I connect with others. I love
              preparing meals with local ingredients and gathering friends and
              neighbors around the table. Food is Appalachian culture, history,
              and community — and ensuring food security here at home is
              something I care deeply about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Travel has broadened my perspective and deepened my appreciation
              for different cultures and traditions. But every time I return
              home to Jonesborough, I'm reminded why I chose to plant roots
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also believe that civic engagement doesn't stop at meetings and
              boards. I have stood alongside neighbors at protests and
              gatherings advocating for equal rights and fairness, because I
              believe everyone deserves dignity, opportunity, and a voice.
              Showing up matters — whether at a public hearing, a community
              event, or in peaceful advocacy for justice.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when I'm not working or volunteering, I'm usually with my Jack
              Russell, Banjo — my constant sidekick, new campaign manager, and
              best friend. Whether we're hiking, gardening (he helps dig the
              holes), or out for a walk, Banjo reminds me to play, laugh, and
              appreciate the everyday beauty of this place.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of these experiences — my work, board service, planning
              initiatives, gardening, food systems, festivals, rivers, and
              community involvement — shape how I approach leadership. They
              remind me that County Commission decisions affect our land, our
              water, our housing, our local economy, and the quality of life we
              pass on to the next generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm running for District 3 because I don't just live here — I
              serve here. And I believe leadership should reflect the same care,
              stewardship, and long-term thinking we bring to our gardens, our
              waterways, and our neighborhoods.
